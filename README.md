# Detection-Lab

## Objective

I built my Detection Lab with the aim to establish a controlled and safe environment to simulate and detect cyber attacks. My primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, I Generated test telemetry that mimics real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was done to help deepen my understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
